## About

I study the Earth and build tools that help people ask better questions about place.

My background spans **Earth sciences, environmental studies, and the humanities**, with field and research experience ranging from **hydrology in Maine** to **geoarchaeology in Oman and Ethiopia**. Today, my work sits at the intersection of **place-based education, geospatial analysis, and open inquiry**.

In recent years, I have focused on **applied coding and open-source mapping tools**—using Python, GIS, and web-based visualization to support **authentic investigations**, land-based learning, and decision-making rooted in local context. I am especially interested in tools that help learners see **patterns, boundaries, histories, and relationships** across landscapes.

I currently serve as an **Education Research Faculty member and Professional Learning Coach at Teton Science Schools**, where I support educators in designing inquiry-driven, culturally responsive learning experiences connected to place.

I care deeply about **inclusive learning environments**, collaborative work, and maintaining a sense of curiosity and lightness—even when working with complex systems.

## How I Think About This Space

This GitHub profile is part of a longer-term effort to make my work **visible, connected, and useful**.

Rather than isolated projects, I see these repositories and apps as **nodes in a larger learning system**—supporting educators, students, and communities in asking meaningful questions about the places they care for and live within.

If something here sparks curiosity or feels useful, I’d be glad to connect.
